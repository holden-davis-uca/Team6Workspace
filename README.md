Here are the remaining tasks, distributed by person. <br>I have realized the true degree to which the input/output will need to be redrawn to meet specifications, so I will not be able to compile the methods + variables into the images: you will have to add them to the diagram yourself (YOU WILL NEED TO ADD THEM TO EVERY DIAGRAM THEY OCCUR IN) and push your commits to the main branch.

!--> IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF ECLIPSE, INSTALL IT. <br>!--> WE WILL BE USING THIS VERSION FOR THE PROJECT AS IT IS MORE RECENTLY UPDATED THAN DR. SMITH'S VERSION. <br>!--> IF YOU INSTALL THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF ECLIPSE AND FOLLOW DR. SMITH'S PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STANDALONE PAPYRUS PLUGIN, IT SHOULD TAKE NO MORE THAN 20 MINUTES AT MOST. <br>!--> DO THIS AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE

* **Holden - DONE** - Refine/Redo Input/Output for each package and add to document. When all methods and variables are finished, fix appearance of every class and redraw all 5 diagrams to be readable (class diagram + package diagram + 3 subsystem diagrams). After all tasks are finished, export all 5 diagrams to png format and add to document, and export papyrus project as zip. As final step, name each individuals contribution in document and submit to blackboard before due date (3/17/22 @ 2:40pm).

If you have any questions about your task or wish to dispute what you have been assigned do so immediately. I will be posting these assignments to the GitHub org project board as well.

Given that I will need time to assemble everything into the single document, the absolute latest you should submit your work to the repo is **11:00am on Thursday.**

I will be able to provide minor further clarification if necessary but I do not possess the time to provide entire walkthroughs regarding material that has already been covered in previous lectures/classes or should already be known. This is a senior-level class and a capstone course for the Computer Science degree.

If you do not know how to install the latest publicly available iteration of Eclipse and setup papyrus with it, Google it or look at the instructions provided by Dr. Smith.
<br>If you do not know how to use Git/Github, Google it or look at today's lecture video.
<br>If you do not know how to create the methods/variables or what they should be, look at the lectures notes and slides Dr. Smith has provided and the instructions for Lab 5 Out.

Godspeed.
